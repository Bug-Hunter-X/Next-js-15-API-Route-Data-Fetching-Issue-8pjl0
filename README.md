# Next.js 15 API Route Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when fetching data from an API route in a Next.js 15 application.  The client-side data fetching fails, resulting in either a blank page or an error message.

## Problem

The `about.js` page attempts to fetch data from `/api/data` using `fetch`.  The API route (`api/data.js`) returns a JSON response. However, the `about` page doesn't display the fetched data; instead, it shows a blank page or a fetch error. 

## Solution

The issue is likely related to missing error handling or improper data handling in the `about.js` component.  The solution involves implementing robust error handling and checking the response status before accessing the `json` data.  Additionally, the API route needs to be configured and tested correctly.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the blank page or error.
